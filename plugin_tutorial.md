# Creating a napari plugin
## Overview
In this tutorial, we will make a napari analysis plugin from the `detect_spots()` function we wrote in the first part of this practical session. The primary steps in making a napari plugin are as follows:

1. choose which hook specification(s) your plugin requires
2. create your repository using the napari cookiecutter template
3. implement the hookspec(s)
4. share your plugin with the community

In the following sections, we will work through steps (1) - (3) and we discussed the process for (4) during the lecture.

## Choosing a hook specification
A hook specification or "hookspec" is a definition for a function that napari uses for a specific type of plugin. In other words, the hook specification defines what napari provides to napari (e.g., data and parameters) and what the plugin returns to napari. napari is then able to use the functions meeting the hook specification to carry out the plugin tasks. The current categories of napari hook specifications are described below. Please see the [hook specification reference](https://napari.org/plugins/stable/hook_specifications.html#hook-specifications-reference) for more details. Many plugins will implement multiple hookspecs to provide all of the required functionality.

- **reader**: allows loading of specified data formats into napari layers
- **writer**: this allows layer data to be written to disk in specified formats
- **sample data**: allows developers to provide users with sample data with their plugin.
- **dock widget**: allows custom Qt widgets (GUIs) to be added to napari
- **function**: the developer provides a function and napari automatically generates the GUI to both set the inputs parameters for the function and run the function.

In this tutorial, we will create a spot detection plugin by implementing the function hookspec with the spot detection function (`detect_spots()`) we created in the first part of this practical session.

## Using the cookiecutter template to create your plugin repository
To make creating the creating plugins easier, we provide a template that automatically builds most of the infrastructure for your plugin, so you can focus on implmenting the details unique to your plugin. The template is implemented using a command line utility called [`cookiecutter`](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter). In the following steps, you will build your plugin directory using the cookiecutter template.

First, open your terminal and navigate to your Documents folder.

```bash
cd ~/Documents
```

Next, activate the conda environment you created in the first part of the tutorial. This environment includes all of the packages required to make your plugin (including `cookiecutter`).

```bash
conda activate napari-tutorial
```

In this next step, we will use `cookiecutter` to create a repository for our plugin from the template. `cookiecutter` will ask a series of questions that that will customize the repository for your plugin. Once completed, the repository will be created in your current directory.

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin
```

You will be asked for some information to customize the setup of your plugin. Each prompt gives the default value in square brackets (`[]`). The questions are explained below. Enter your answer after the prompt and press enter to continue.

- `full_name [Napari Developer]`: enter your name here. Names entered here will be listed as the authors of the plugin in the package metadata.
- `email [yourname@example.com]`: this email will be listed as the contact information in the package metadata
- `github_username [githubuser]`: if you have a github username, you can enter it here
- `plugin_name [napari-foobar]`: enter the name you would like your plugin to be called. spaces are not allowed and are often replaced with `-` (e.g., `napari-spot-detector`).
- `module_name [napari_foobar]`: this is the name of the module containing your plugin code. typically, this is the plugin name with the `-` replaced with `_` (e.g., `napari_spot_detector`).
- `short_description [A simple plugin to use with napari]`: give a one sentence description of your plugin. This will go into the readme.\
- `include_reader_plugin [y]`: answer`y` (for yes) if you would like a reader plugin. We do not need a reader plugin for this tutorial, so answer `n` for no.
- `include_writer_plugin [y]`answer`y` (for yes) if you would like a writer plugin. We do not need a reader plugin for this tutorial, so answer `n` for no.
- `include_dock_widget_plugin [y]`: answer`y` (for yes) if you would like a dock widget plugin. We do not need a reader plugin for this tutorial, so answer `n` for no.
- `include_function_plugin [y]`: answer`y` (for yes) if you would like a reader plugin. We are implementing a function plugin for this tutorial, so answer `y` for yes.
- `use_git_tags_for_versioning [n]`: we will not be covering setting plugin versions in this tutorial, so enter `n` for no.
- `Select docs_tool`: the repository can be set up to build documentation from your plugin using one of the popular frameworks. We will not be making documentation in this tutorial, so select option 3 (none).
- `Select license`: select the license you would like to use for your plugin. The license sets the rules for how others can build upon and re-use your plugin code. For more information on typical open source licenses, [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) is a good primer. The default choice for is [BSD-3](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

After completing all of the questions, a new directory will be created containing your new napari plugin. You will be given instructions on how to initialize the git repository and upload it to github. By default, we will not be covering this aspect in the tutorial, but please feel free to ask the teaching team if you would like to give it a try. Your new plugin directory (assuming you called the plugin `napari-spot-detector` and the module `napari_spot_detector`) will be organized as follows

```

See below for explanations about some of the most notable files, but do not hesitate to reach out to the teaching team if you have questions about any of the other files.

- `.github/workflows/test_and_deploy.yml`: this is a [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow that will automatically run the tests and upload your plugin to pypi (thus making it available through the build-in napari plugin browser). Please ask the teaching team if you would like to learn how to set up your github repository to support the workflow.
- `setup.py` and `setup.cfg`: these files allow you plugin to be installed by pip. the cookiecutter template has set everything up in these files, so you are good to go!
- `napari_spot_detector/_function.py`: This file implement the function hook specification. This is where you will add your `detect_spot()` function. 

You have now set up the directory for your new plugin! You can explore the directory and files with the file browser. In the next step, you will complete your plugin by adding your `detect_spots()` function to the `_function.py` file.

## Implementing a function hookspec
In this step, we will implement our `detect_spots()` function in the function hookspec. First, we will add our spot detection function to the plugin package. Then, we will add the type annotations to the function to so that napari can infer the correct GUI elements to add to our plugin.



1. To edit your plugin source code, open it in VSCode (an integrated development environment we have installed on the virtual machines).
	- Open the [system search](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/gs-use-system-search.html.en) by either clicking "Activities" in the upper left hand corner of the screen or pressing the "super key" (typically "command" on Mac or Windows key on Windows).
	- Search for VSCode and click on it
2. In VSCode, open the directory you created with `cookiecutter` in the section above. 
	- From the "File" menu, select "Open..."
	- Navigate to and select the directory you created with `cookiecutter` (`~/Documents/napari-spot-detector` if you called your plugin `napari-spot-detector)`. 
3. You should now see your plugin directory in the "Explorer" pane in the left hand side of the window. You can double click on folders to expand them and files to open them in the editor.
4. Open the `<module_name>/_function.py` file using VSCode by double clicking on it in the "Explorer" pane.
5. You will see that it has already been populated with a few code blocks by cookiecutter.
	- At the top, you see the imports. You can leave unchanged for now.

	```python
	from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

	from enum import Enum
	import numpy as np
	from napari_plugin_engine import napari_hook_implementation
	
	if TYPE_CHECKING:
	    import napari
	```
	- Next, you see the function hookspec. We will modify this to return our `detect_spots` function.

	```python
	# This is the actual plugin function, where we export our function
	# (The functions themselves are defined below)
	@napari_hook_implementation
	def napari_experimental_provide_function():
	    # we can return a single function
	    # or a tuple of (function, magicgui_options)
	    # or a list of multiple functions with or without options, as shown here:
	    return [threshold, image_arithmetic]
	```
	
	- Finally, you see two example functions. We will replace these with our `detect_spots()` function.
6. Delete the example functions. You can delete everything below the comment `# 1.  First example,...`.
7. Copy the `gaussian_high_pass()` and `detect_spots()` functions from your notebook from the first part of the tutorial and paste it where the example functions were (the ones you deleted in the previous step).
8. Next, we need to modify `detect_spots()` to return the necessary layer data so that napari can create a new Points layer with our detected spots. If `detect_spots()` returns a `LayerDataTuple`, napari will add a new layer to the viewer using the data in the `LayerDataTuple`. For more information on the `LayerDataTuple` type, please see the lecture slides or [the docs](https://napari.org/guides/stable/magicgui.html#returning-napari-types-layerdatatuple).
	- The layer data tuple should be: `(layer_data, layer_options, layer_type)`
	- `layer_data`: the data to be displayed in the new layer (i.e., the points coordinates)
	- `layer_options`: the display options for the layer stored as a dictionary. Some options to consider: `symbol`, `size`
	- `layer_type`: the name of the layer type as a string (i.e., `'Points'`)
9. Add type annotations to the function parameters (inputs). Napari (via [magicgui](https://napari.org/magicgui/)) will infer the required GUI elements from the type annotations. We have to add annotations to both the parameters (i.e., inputs to the function) and the 
10. Annotate the Return type as `"napari.types.LayerDataTuple"`. 
11.  Note that in the step above, we annotate the Return type as `"napari.types.LayerDataTuple"`

## Explore the other files generated by cookiecutter
In order for napari to automatically find and make your plugin available to the user once it has been installed (i.e., "discoverable"), we must add a `napari.plugin` entry point to the `setup.cfg` file. An entry point is a way that a python package can advertise that it has a component available (our plugin in this case). napari searches the python environment for packages that have a `napari.plugin` and then searches the specified module for functions that have been decorated with the `@napari_hook_implementation` decorator.

If we open the `setup.cfg` file created by `cookiecutter`, we see that the entry point was already added by the cookiecutter template! If you called your plugin `napari-spot-detector` and your module `napari_spot_detector`, you will see the following:

```
[options.entry_points] 
napari.plugin = 
    napari-spot-detector = napari_spot_detector
```

## Testing/Installing your plugin
To test and use our plugin, we need to install it in our python environment. First, return to your terminal and verify you have the `napari-tutorial` environment activated. Then, navigate to the directory that you created with the cookiecutter. For example, if you named your plugin `napari-spot-detector`, you would enter the following into your terminal.

```bash
cd ~/Documents/napari-spot-detector
```

Then, we install the plugin with pip. pip is the package installer for python (see [the documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for more information). We will use the `-e` option to install in "editable" mode. This means that when we in make a change to our 

```bash
pip install -e .
```

To confirm if your installation completed successfully, you can launch napari from the command line.

```bash
napari
```

Once napari is open, you can open your plugin from the "Plugin" menu. You can test your plugin by locating the spots image from the spot detection tutorial in the File browser (`~/Documents/napari-spot-detection-tutorial/data/spots_cropped.tif`), dragging the image into the napari viewer, and try running the plugin.

Congratulations! You have made your first napari plugin!


## Bonus exercises

In case you have finished all of the exercises with some time to spare, we have provided some ideas for ways that you can extend the plugin. Please feel free to give them a go and ask the teaching team if you have any questions.

- add sample data to your plugin. To do so, you would need to implement the [sample data hookspec](https://napari.org/docs/dev/plugins/hook_specifications.html#napari.plugins.hook_specifications.napari_provide_sample_data)
- add an option to your `detect_spots()` function plugin to return the filtered image in addition to the points layer.
- add some tests to the `_tests/test_function.py` file.
- upload your plugin to github
- start your own plugin
- consult with the teaching team about integrating napari into your workflow
